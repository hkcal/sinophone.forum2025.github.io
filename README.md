## Sinophone Research Forum: Island Voices on the Move 

Sinophone refers to communities and cultures that share their roots in Sinitic languages and orthography. Shih Shu-mei defines the Sinophone world as a network of places where Sinitic-language cultures are produced. Given this non-monolithic definition, Sinophone communities are essentially heterogeneous and decentralized, and thus develop unique cultural identities that are distinct yet share common roots. Such a process includes the production and circulation of cultural, artistic and linguistic artefacts across different Sinophone communities. Of central importance are issues related to identity and the lived experience of marginalized populations across the globe.  

Following this research tradition, we call for abstracts that challenge the simplistic equivalence among language, culture, ethnicity, and nationality and explore the diverse and overlapping margins of various identities, especially against the backdrop of migration. In particular, we invite submissions that explore the intersection between these issues and how they are manifested in culture, arts and languages.   

We are especially interested in submissions on Hong Kong and Taiwan, which tend to be underrepresented in the global representation of the Sinophone community. Comparative works and submissions on other locales, e.g. Singapore, Malaysia and North America, are also welcome.
