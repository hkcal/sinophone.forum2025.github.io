            <h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
            <p>The forum focuses on the global Sinophone communities. We welcome proposals for individual papers (20-minute papers) and 3-paper panels. </p>
            <p> We are especially interested in submissions on Hong Kong and Taiwan, which tend to be underrepresented in the global representation of the Sinophone community. Comparative works and submissions on other locales, e.g. Singapore, Malaysia and North America, are also welcome.  </p>
